==== What is this?
It is a library for humans (and some robots). This library is a client
of Scratch API, so lots of features are available. But the development
team decided to remove all deprecated features.

It consists of some classes, such as:
* Meta (Information, Search, Statistics)
* Misc (Special Features such as Translate API)
* User (Scratch user)
* Project (Scratch project)
* FrontPage (Scratch Front Page API)
and some classes just for developers...

==== Requirements
* Python 3.0+, should be 3.5+, tested on CPython 3.6.1
* Requests (should be the latest version)

==== For people who want to add a feature
1. Make sure the API exists! Test by YOURSELF.
2. If it needs CSRF token, make the code, PLEASE MAKE IT!
3. Please tell at least one reference. Available references:
* https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www (read the code)
* https://github.com/LLK/scratch-rest-api/wiki
* Scratch Wiki

==== (By the way) Story
On June 9th, apple502j, the programmer on the team started making it.
When making, Kenny2scratch always helps. The great co-worker made this
library greater. For example, GenericData was made by him.
